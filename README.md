# DSA Track – Structured Problem-Solving Journey

A systematic, pattern-driven approach to Data Structures & Algorithms.  
This repository reflects consistent execution, topic-based mastery, and measurable growth.

## Objectives
- Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Develop mastery across core DSA patterns
- Maintain disciplined, high-frequency practice
- Start with Python → transition to C++ for performance-oriented roles

## Weekly KPIs
- 10–20 problems per week minimum
- 70%+ medium-level focus after Month 2
- Weekly pattern consolidation (arrays, hashing, sliding window, recursion, DP, graphs)
